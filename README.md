Repo for Module 18 Challenge (Tableau City Bike Challenge)

Project Title: City Bike Challenge
Project Description: Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data Links to an external site. webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.


Using Code: Use Tableau to access files for Citi Bike Data Reporting.
